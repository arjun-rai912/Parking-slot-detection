# Parking Slot Detection

# Description
This project is aimed at developing a computer vision based solution to detect empty parking slots in a parking lot. The system will use cameras installed in the parking lot to capture images of the parking spots. These images will then be processed using computer vision techniques to detect and locate empty parking spots. The system will be able to identify an empty spot by analyzing various features such as color, shape, and size of the spot. The project will also use machine learning techniques to train a model that can accurately predict the status of a parking spot (empty or occupied) based on the images captured. The goal is to develop a real-time system that can efficiently detect empty parking spots and help drivers find an available spot quickly, reducing traffic congestion and making the parking experience more efficient




## Prerequisites
Before you get started, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

*  Python 3.6 or higher
* OpenCV
* Numpy


## Deployment

This system can be deployed in a parking lot by installing cameras at strategic positions to capture images of the parking spots. The system can then process these images in real-time to identify empty spots and display the information to drivers through a user-friendly interface such as a display board or a mobile application.
